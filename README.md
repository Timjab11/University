"# University" 
This github was created to archive works I have done in my study on Universities and personal projects.
As it wasnt done soon enough, it will be more blank than it should be as not all assignments and projects are accesible to me.
Either because lack of access to the databases, or because they were lost on another memory.

I will try to get my other assignments and projects here so it wont be as empty.
I am still trying to recover things i have on MFF UK, which are archived as C++, python, more C# and efficient algorithms.
Hopefully this will be enough for now, I will be happy to talk about it in detail as I love programming and creativity, this site will archive my future works as well so they shall never get lost in the void again, in the future.
