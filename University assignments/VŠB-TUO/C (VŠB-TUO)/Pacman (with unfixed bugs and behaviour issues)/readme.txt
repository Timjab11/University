In a text file named map.txt, the dimensions y and x (map dimensions) are defined.
After that, within these dimensions, you can write letters indicating what should be at each position.

Warning: There can be multiple ghosts, but there can only be one player.

x … wall
o … dot
r … superDot (or pill)
p … pacman
' ' … an empty space is simply an empty space
Pacman moves using a buffer, so don't expect an immediate turn.
