Write a program using the SDL library that allows the user to create snowflakes that will "snow" (fall down). The snowflakes will be created with random size, speed, and rotation. The snowflakes will fall down while rotating. The falling speed and rotation will be influenced by the randomly generated speed of the snowflake. Once a snowflake goes past the bottom edge of the screen, it will be freed from memory and will no longer be drawn.
